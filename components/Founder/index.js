            <h1>MEET THE FOUNDER</h1>
            <p>
              Gasigwa Theogene was born and raised in Rwanda and he’s passionate about his homeland.
              It’s a country that he knows and loves well, but life hasn’t been easy for him.
            </p>
            <p>
              At only two weeks old he was taken to the Noel Orphanage in Rubavu after both his parents died in the atrocities leading up to the Genocide in 1994.
              For the next twenty four years he lived a life of hardship and struggle with his ‘brothers and sisters’, in the Orphanage. He faced many challenges but he was always determined to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              He excelled at school where he studied Tourism and Hospitality. At university he was proud to graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management with Distinction.
              Opportunities followed and he gained invaluable working experience at Nyungwe National Park, Lake Kivu Serena Hotel and Akagera National Park.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gasigwa’s zest for life and the love he feels for his homeland have only made him more determined to introduce others to the joys and beauty of Rwanda- The Land of a Thousand Hills.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a difficult start, he knows that his success will give hope and promise to those ‘brothers and sisters’, who were there struggling with him in the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, he’s ready to show you his Rwanda.
